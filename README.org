* How you catch their hand in the cookie jar:

If you publish your dotfiles to the internet, you're probably going to want to:

+ Use [[https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page][SE Linux]].
  - I'm not a Chef user, but this video and [[https://github.com/sous-chefs/selinux][this repo]] should get you started.
  - *TLDR:* SE Linux turns the kernel into a giant modular synth, where
    inputs/outputs are authorized.
+ Become more aware of [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEJEA9mYfeKidV28y542zNwCSJ02j63ih][Data Forensics]] and OSINT
+ Keep SSH off when you're not using it...
  - This gets harder when you start doing more advanced net-fu.
+ Avoid Wifi networks (even disabling wifi at home or the office)
  - Recently discovered [[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/farewell-to-firewalls-wi-fi-bugs-open-network-devices-to-remote-hacks/][Frag Attacks]], have been an issue for decades
  - *TLDR:* wifi is too good to be true
+ Run containerized apps, even Emacs, from within Docker containers or Minikube
  - This provides an extra layer of security when used with SE Linux
+ Use an on-premises security appliance like TSE: [[https://securityonionsolutions.com/][The Security Onion]]
  - And ship your logs.
  - You'll need to configure an OpenWRT router to duplex traffic. You'll need
    about $150 for that And about $500 for hardware/storage to run the
    appliance.
  - Assume that the government is already watching, but notice how the police
    NEVER show up at your house to help you out. This is a second-amendment
    issue. You want protection at your home when they aren't going to tell
    you how they're "protecting" you.
  - The threat is not the government, btw. The real threats are tools in the
    hands of cyber-criminals. When someone is hacking you or your private info,
    you will always be three steps behind and left wondering "how did they beat
    me? how did they know? did they know?" That's the dead giveaway, but it's too late.
+ Use SE Linux
